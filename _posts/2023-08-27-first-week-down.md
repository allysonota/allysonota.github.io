<h2>LTEC</H2>
Orientation for the ph.d. program was fun and lessened my anxiety about entering the program. The first week of the Fall 2023 semester is over. There are ten of us who will move through the core curriculum together. Seven of us are brand spanking new, and the other 3 took electives in their first year and we are now on this academic adventure as a cohort. 

So far, we are required to take LTEC 750C - Seminar in Educational Technology Issues. We can take one elective outside the LTEC major to go towards our degree, so I opted to take an elective in my old stomping grounds--the Library school at UHM, since there were no electives I could take in LTEC this fall, and I thought it'd be interesting and useful: LIS 665 - Digital Instruction. 

What can I say? SO MUCH READING. And...I am a slow reader. 

In 750C, I'm in a group of 3, and we'll be working on 2 projects. One is a reading journal where we each have to annotate an equal amount of required readings--in addition to 4 more readings we select and add to the library throughout the next 09 weeks. I spent some time fiddling with Zotero, which we'll be using as a group in 750C with a shared library that we'll export our annotations from. 

I also set up a Discord server so we could communicate asynchronously. Slack now makes content unavailable for free accounts after 90 days, so the move to Discord felt necessary. I've used both, and like Discord so far. I feel the pressure of group work and I read even slower when taking notes and trying to actually absorb and annotate for the team. I reflect now on my reflection and think it was dumb. I may have to update it. 

Two main works we seem to be reading chapters from, are: 
<ul><li><p>
Dron, J., & Anderson, T. (2014). <i>Teaching crowds: Learning and social media</i>. Athabasca University Press. https://doi.org/10.15215/aupress/9781927356807.01. </p></li>
<li><p>Lowyck, J. (2014). Bridging learning theories and technology-enhanced environments: A critical appraisal of Its history. In J. M. Spector, M. D. Merrill, J. Elen, & M. J. Bishop (Eds.), <i>Handbook of research on educational communications and technology</i> (Fouth Edittion, pp. 3â€“20). Springer New York. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3185-5_1.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>LIS</h2>
So far, I was admitted to the course at the end of week 1, and was able to complete most of the tasks requested of us. I hope to do well in this course. 
<h2>Personal life & Productivity tools</h2>
What personal life? LOL! Well, I am trying to make sure I spend some time working out, since I both enjoy and benefit from it! I am also trying out new productivity tools to help me with school and work, such as: 
<ul>
<li><p>I've got a weekly planner to hand-write upcoming deadlines for school & work in</p></li>
<li><p>I've caved and reactivated my paid subscription to Speechify. It is somewhat pricey, but I do like using it to listen to articles while walking or cleaning house, or driving to work. I can listen on my desktop computer and mobile devices since there is an iOS app.</p></li>
<li><p>I'm using Adobe Acrobat to annotate PDFs. Just some simple highlighting, underlining, and the addition of quick notes. The downfall I feel in this, is I can only really use it on a desktop computer.</p></li> 
<li><p>I am trying out a vegan subscription food service -- more details on that in perhaps another post.</p></li>
</ul>
Any recommendations for productivity software you like to use for your studies? Hit me up! <br />
A hui hou.
