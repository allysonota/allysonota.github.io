On Tuesday, February 8, 2022, I received one shot of cortisone in each foot to deal with heel pain that manifested on the left, and then eventually started to be felt on the right. In addition to the shots, I have been trying to stretch, massage my calves, and take it a bit easier. No more walking 3 - 6 miles at a time. No more running high speeds on the treadmill. Instead, I've tried the strider (like an elliptical), the stationatry bike, and today was my first time back on the treadmill, but at a slower pace than just before the injury. So far, things seem OK. The pain is gone, and I'm doing my best not to aggravate things.
