I signed up for a Library Juice Academy course with instructor Chris Diaz, called [Git and GitHub for Libraries](https://libraryjuiceacademy.com/shop/course/268-git-and-github-for-libraries/).
In our first week, we could pick a reading and then post reflectively about it. I decided to read about creating a personal
site using Jeckyll, by [Jonathan McGlone](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/). I have been interested in learning more about Git, and using it in school and my daily work.
