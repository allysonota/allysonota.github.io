My contract renewal dossier is due on Sept. 15th. I also applied to, and was accepted into, the Learning Design & Technology (LTEC) PhD program and will be starting this Fall. Classes start on August 21st. 

Maui has suffered from terrible wildfires and winds from passing hurricane Dora, in addition to having suffered severe drought conditions. Lāhainā looks like it has been decimated. The fires started really raging on Wednesday, August 8th, and overnight people were forced to flee. Though I do not have any relatives or friends on Maui, I feel heartbreak for the lives lost and destruction. 

My problems are small in the great scheme of things. Sending my hopes for healing to Maui.
